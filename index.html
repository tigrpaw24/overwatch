            <img class="photo"src="img/lake.jpg" alt="lake"> 
            <p>I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
            My biological sperm donor was stationed there for the Navy. 
            We lived there until I was 3 years old. Then we moved to Michigan
            where both my parents grew up. My parents divorced shortly after and 
            my mom moved my older brother and me to Battle Creek and that's where we stayed.
            I graduated from Lakeview High School in 1989. </p>

            <h2>Military Life</h2>

            <p> I enlisted into the military in January of 1989 through the Delayed Entry Program.
            I was only 17 at the time so I had to get my parents permission and they had to sign 
            paperwork saying they agreed to it. I entered basic training for the Army in September
            of 1989 at Fort Dix, New Jersey. From there I went to my AIT in Fort Rucker, Alabama where
            I trained to be a helicopter mechanic. I graduated top of my class and recieved the Army
            Achievement Medal for my hard work. I went to Fort Benning, Georgia after that where I 
            graduated from the U.S. Army Airborne School. From there I was stationed at Fort Bragg,
            North Carolina with the 82nd Aviation Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. I deployed to Saudi
            Arabia on Thanksgiving Day, 1990, for Operation Desert Shield and then moved up into Iraq 
            during Operation Desert Storm. Due to many issues caused by exposure to chemical warfare, 
            bad vaccines, and an experimental anti-nerve agent pill they forced us to take that caused my 
            central and peripheral nervous systems go haywire and become dysfunctional. I am also a 
            Military Sexual Trauma survivor from being sexually assaulted by a guy in my unit four days 
            after returning from the war. The culmanation of these things forced my military career to 
            be cut short and I was discharged in 1991.</p>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>

            <p>My future goals are to find a full time job in the tech field with the hopes of making 
            it a successful career. I do graphic artwork also, so I hope to merge the coding and
            my art together and possibly work on developing applications. I plan on continuing to learn as many
            different types of coding as I can to stay up to date with changing technology.
